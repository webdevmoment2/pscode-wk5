// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

x=input number
y=input number
console.log (x + y)

// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

x=input number

if (x % 2 = 0) {
console.log ("This number is even!")
}

else {
console.log("This number is odd!")
}

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.

function(average) = sum of all the numbers in the array / length of array

c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.

function (smallest) = Math.min(...numbers)

function (largest) = Math.max(...numbers)

d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

console.log("The average of the array is " + average(numbers) + "!")

console.log("The smallest value in the array is " + smallest + " and the largest value is " + largest + "!")
